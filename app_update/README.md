### Work in progress üèóÔ∏è

To support its development, you can give it a like and a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/StarProxima/dev_kit).

# Overview

This package is designed to help handle updates to your application in a more flexible way.

It should also help fix problems and get around some annoying limitations of the [Upgrader](https://pub.dev/packages/upgrader) package.

You can show anything you want - a customizable dialog, a modal sheet or a small card to motivate or compel users to update your app. 

The package also supports features such as deprecation for older versions, required updates and rolling back updates.



# Setup methods

There are 2 methods to get information about updates: 
1) From the stores where the app is available 
2) From your own update config, which can be hosted, for example, on your public github repository.

The first method is easier to use, but is not flexible and does not support many features.

The second method requires some customization, but works on all platforms, with all stores, and allows for full control and customization of your update process.

We want to support both methods, but for now we're focusing on the second method.

## Update Config

Here is the full config api structure under consideration:
```yaml

# Shorebird

Information about new patches is provided by shorebird.
