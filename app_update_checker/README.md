### Work in progress üèóÔ∏è

To support its development, you can give it a like and a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/StarProxima/dev_kit).

# Overview

This package is designed to help handle updates to your application in a more flexible way.

It should also help fix problems and get around some annoying limitations of the [Upgrader](https://pub.dev/packages/upgrader) package.

You can show anything you want - a customizable dialog, a modal sheet or a small card to motivate or compel users to update your app. 

The package also supports features such as deprecation for older versions, required updates and rolling back updates.



# Setup methods

There are 2 methods to get information about updates: 
1) From the stores where the app is available 
2) From your own update config, which can be hosted, for example, on your public github repository.

The first method is easier to use, but is not flexible and does not support many features.

The second method requires some customization, but works on all platforms, with all stores, and allows for full control and customization of your update process.

We want to support both methods, but for now we're focusing on the second method.

## Update Config

# Shorebird

If you use [Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/), the Code Push tool for Flutter, this package also allows you to process and show users information about a new patch with release notes with the ability to restart the application.

If you don't need a patch note and a custom title and description, you can omit specific patches from the release. Information about new patches is also provided by shorebird.

```yaml

# Default settings for patches
path_settings:
  # Optional, similar to release title
  title: The new patch is available!
  # Optional, similar to release description
  description: It is needed to fix errors in the app.

releases:
  - version: 1.3.7
    patches:
      - patch_number: 1 # Required
        # Optional, similar to release type
        type: active
        # Optional, you can set the title, description and patchNote.
        title: New patch for $appVersion
        patch_note: Critical fix
        # Optional, uses to refine the version
        build_number: 21

        # Related patch for another platform with different patch number

        # uses all of its parameters by default
