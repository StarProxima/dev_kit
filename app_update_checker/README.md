#### Work in progress üèóÔ∏è

To support its development, you can give it a like and a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/StarProxima/dev_kit).

## Overview

This package is designed to help handle updates to your application in a more flexible way.

It should also help fix problems and get around some annoying limitations of the [Upgrader](https://pub.dev/packages/upgrader) package.

You can show anything you want - a customizable dialog, a modal sheet or a small card to motivate or compel users to update your app. 

The package also supports features such as deprecation for older versions, required updates and rolling back updates.



## Setup

There are 2 methods to get information about updates: 
1) From the stores where the app is available 
2) From your own config, which can be hosted, for example, on your public github repository.

The first method is easier to use, but is not flexible and does not support many features.

The second method requires some customization, but works on all platforms, with all stores, and allows for full control and customization of your update process.

We want to support both methods, but for now we're focusing on the second method.

Here is the config api structure under consideration:
```yaml
# Description of the api structure
# https://pub.dev/packages/app_update_checker

# Interval at which the update notification will be repeatedly shown to the user.
reminderPeriodInHours: 48
# Delay that must pass after the release before it begins to be shown to all users.
releaseDelayInHours: 48

# Versions prior to this one will receive an obsolescence notice, but may defer the update.
deprecatedBeforeVersion: 0.3.7
# Versions prior to this one must be updated to the latest version, with no option to defer the update.
requiredMinimumVersion: 0.1.0 

# Optional, will be set based on the platform and app ID.

## Shorebird

If you use [Shorebird](https://shorebird.dev/), the Code Push tool for Flutter, this package also allows you to process and show users information about a new patch with release notes with the ability to restart the application.

```yaml

releases:
  - version: 1.3.7
    patches:
      - patchNumber: 1 # Required
        # Optional, should use the patch
        isActive: true 
        # Optional, the patch is mandatory for installation by all before using the app
        isRequired: false 
        # Optional, if true - becomes inactive, will be required to upgrade to any higher patch
        isBroken: false
        # Optional, you can set the title, description and releaseNote
        releaseNote: 
          en: 'Critical fix'
        # Optional, uses to refine the version
        buildNumber: 21
    platforms:
      - android
